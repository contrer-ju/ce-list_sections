# GOAL

The intention of this application is to make an interface that contains two sections, where it is possible to add items to the first section and then send them to the second section, return them to the first section, edit them within the first section, delete them within any of the two sections (either by selecting them individually or by emptying the entire section list). A dynamic search box is also included for each of the sections.
